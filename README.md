# Warehouse Automation Robot Algorithm

### 1. System Initialization
- Perform hardware connection (sensors, robotic arms, conveyor belts)
- Establish connection with warehouse management software (WMS)
- Load current inventory data and warehouse layout

### 2. Scanning Process
- The robots perform regular shelf scans using computer vision for untagged items.


### 3. Storage Optimization
- Implement dynamic slotting based on:
  - Item expiration dates (FIFO/FEFO)
  - Demand frequency patterns
  - Product category groupings

### 4. Order Fulfillment Workflow
1. Receive picking request from WMS
2. Calculate most efficient retrieval path
3. Deploy robotic arm/retrieval unit and move in x,y plane
4. Verify item with barcode/RFID scan
5. Transport to packing station via conveyor

### 5. Working Envelopes
- **Physical Space**: Defined operational zones for:
  - Robotic arms (3D reach parameters)
  - AMR navigation paths
  - Conveyor system routes

### 6. Human-Machine Interface
- Dashboard showing:
  - Real-time system status
  - Exception alerts
